### Added

- Initial release with the following features:
  - VPN preparation.
  - Socket protection.
  - Session management.
  - Address and route management.

## Installation

### 1. Add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_vpn_service:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/your_username/flutter_vpn_service.git
```

### Alternatively, if you have published the package on pub.dev, you can add it like this:

```yaml
dependencies:

```

### 2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Configure your Android project:

Ensure that your Android app has the necessary permissions and configurations for using the VPN service. Add the following to your AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VPN"/>
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.vpn" android:required="true"/>
```

### 4. Platform-Specific Configuration:

Android: The plugin currently supports Android and does not require any special configurations beyond the AndroidManifest.xml permissions above.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic guide on how to use the flutter_vpn_service plugin:

### 1. Prepare VPN

Before you can start using the VPN, you need to prepare it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_vpn_service/flutter_vpn_service.dart';

Future<void> prepareVpn() async {
  bool isPrepared = await FlutterVpnService.prepare();
  if (isPrepared) {
    print("VPN is prepared and ready to use.");
  } else {
    print("VPN is already prepared.");
  }
}
```

### 2. Protect a Socket

You can protect specific sockets to use the VPN.

```dart
Future<void> protectSocket(int socket) async {
  bool success = await FlutterVpnService.protectSocket(socket);
  if (success) {
    print("Socket is now protected by VPN.");
  } else {
    print("Failed to protect the socket.");
  }
}
```

### 3. Set Session Name

Set a session name for the VPN connection.

```dart
Future<void> setSession(String session) async {
  bool success = await FlutterVpnService.setSession(session);
  if (success) {
    print("Session set to $session.");
  } else {
    print("Failed to set session.");
  }
}
```

### 4. Add Address

Add an IP address and its associated prefix length to the VPN configuration.

```dart
Future<void> addAddress(String address, int prefixLength) async {
  bool success = await FlutterVpnService.addAddress(address, prefixLength);
  if (success) {
    print("Address $address added with prefix length $prefixLength.");
  } else {
    print("Failed to add address.");
  }
}
```

### 5. Establish VPN

Finally, establish the VPN connection.

```dart
Future<void> establishVpn() async {
  bool success = await FlutterVpnService.establishVpn();
  if (success) {
    print("VPN connection established.");
  } else {
    print("Failed to establish VPN connection.");
  }
}
```

## Example

Here is a complete example of how you can use the flutter_vpn_service plugin in your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_vpn_service/flutter_vpn_service.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter VPN Service',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter VPN Service Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              await FlutterVpnService.prepare();
              await FlutterVpnService.setSession("My VPN Session");
              await FlutterVpnService.addAddress("192.168.1.1", 32);
              await FlutterVpnService.establishVpn();
            },
            child: Text('Start VPN'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Notes

Permissions: Make sure your Android app has the required permissions for using the VPN

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VPN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

Testing: This plugin is designed to work on Android. Make sure to test it on a physical device rather than an emulator, as VPN functionality may not work properly on an emulator.
